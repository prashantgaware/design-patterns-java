Factory Design Pattern:

    - Factory Design Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern.
    - Factory Design Pattern is used to create objects without exposing the object creation logic.
    - Factory Design Pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
        we need to return one of the sub-class.
    - Factory Design Pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
    - Factory Design Pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code.
    - Factory Design Pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend. For example, we can easily add
        another product type in future.
    - Factory Design Pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.
    - According to Gang of Four (GOF), the Factory Design Pattern states that A factory is an object which
        is used for creating other objects. In technical terms, we can say that a factory is a class with a method.
        That method will create and return different types of objects based on the input parameter, it received.
    -In simple words, if we have a superclass and n number of subclasses, and based on the data provided,
        if we have to create and return the object of one of the subclasses, then we need to use the Factory
        Design Pattern in Java.
    - Factory Design Pattern is also known as Factory Method Design Pattern.
    - Factory Design Pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java.

Note:
    The Factory design pattern offers valuable advantages in encapsulating object creation,
    promoting loose coupling, enhancing flexibility and extensibility, centralizing creation logic,
    and encouraging dependency inversion. Its benefits include encapsulation and abstraction, loose coupling,
    flexibility, centralized object creation, and adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle. However, it is
    important to consider potential drawbacks, including increased complexity, coupling between the factory and concrete
    implementations, limited dynamic object creation, and maintenance overhead. By carefully evaluating the
    requirements of the system and considering trade-offs, developers can leverage the Factory pattern to create
    objects in a flexible and maintainable manner, promoting code reuse and modularity.

    Ex.
        1. DriverManager.getConnection() method in JDBC API.
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test", "root", "root");
        2. Calendar.getInstance() method in Java.
            Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        3. NumberFormat.getInstance() method in Java.
            NumberFormat numberFormat = NumberFormat.getInstance();
        4. factory.getBean() method in Spring Framework.
            ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
            Employee employee = (Employee) context.getBean("employee");

    # Most of the JDBC methods are factory methods.
        ex. DriverManager.getConnection(), DriverManager.getDriver(), DriverManager.getDrivers(), DriverManager.getURL()
            Statement.executeQuery(), Statement.executeUpdate(), Statement.executeBatch(), Statement.executeLargeBatch()

## Problem Statement:
   ==================

    We have several related classes (classes with common interfaces and common superclasses) making client creating
    object for each class difficult. Making it burden on client application.

    => every client must know about all the classes and how to create object for each class.
    => creating multiple objects for different classes and using only few of them is wastage of resources.
    => if we add new class, then we need to modify client code to create object for new class.
    => if we remove a class, then we need to modify client code to remove object creation for that class.


## Solution
    - Provide a factory class to all clients to create object for each class.
    - factory class will be having a stattic/non static method to create object for each class.
    - client will call factory method to create object for each class.
    - client will be passing the type of object to be created to factory method.
    - factory method will create object for the type passed and return the object to client.
    - client will be using the object returned by factory method.


## What is factory method:
    - the method that is capable of creating or returning its own object or related class objects
    or unrelated class objects is called factory method.
    - Different types of factory methods:
        1. Static factory method
            - invokable on class name
            - ex.   1. DriverManager.getConnection() : returning its own claas object
                    2. Calendar.getInstance() : returning its own class object
                    3. NumberFormat.getInstance() : returning its own class object
                    4. Unrelated class objects: ex. Boolean.valueOf(), Integer.valueOf(), Double.valueOf(), System.getProperty()

        2. Non-static factory method
            - invokable on object
            - ex.   1. factory.getBean() : returning its own class object
                    2. factory.getDriver() : returning its own class object
                    3. factory.getDrivers() : returning its own class object
                    4. factory.getURL() : returning its own class object
                    5. String s = new String("Hello"); s.toUpperCase() : returning its own class object
                    6. StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello"); String s = sb.toString() : returning unrelated class object

## Difference b/w factory method and factory design pattern
    - factory method is a method that is capable of creating or returning its own object or related class objects
    or unrelated class objects.
    - factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
    but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    - Factory DP uses factory method in controlled manner to create objects.

    Ex. Properties props = System.getProperties(); // factory method but not factory design pattern

        Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(); // factory method cum factory DP
        Connection con = factory.getConnection(); // factory design pattern

## 3 types of Factory Design Patterns:
    1. Simple Factory Design Pattern
    2. Factory Method Design Pattern
    3. Abstract Factory Design Pattern

### Factory method design pattern :
    - if multiple factories are creating and returning same family class objects( related classes of having common super class)
    then we need factory method design pattern to make all factories to return same family class objects having sma standards.
    - Ex.
                           BajajFactory
                         /      |       \
                        /       |        \
                     Pulsar  Discover  Platina
        these are related classes having common super class or commonly implemented interfaces.
