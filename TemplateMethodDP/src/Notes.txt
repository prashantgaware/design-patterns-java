Template Method Design Pattern:
===============================

- The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- It is used to define a common algorithm in a base class and let subclasses provide specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm.
- The pattern is useful when you have multiple classes that share a common algorithm but differ in some specific steps.
- It promotes code reuse and helps to avoid code duplication by allowing subclasses to inherit the common algorithm from the base class.
- The pattern consists of two main components:
  1. Abstract Class: This class defines the template method, which is the algorithm's skeleton. It contains the common steps of the algorithm and may call abstract methods that subclasses must implement.
  2. Concrete Class: These classes inherit from the abstract class and provide specific implementations for the abstract methods defined in the base class.
- The template method is usually marked as final to prevent subclasses from overriding it, ensuring that the algorithm's structure remains intact.
- The pattern is commonly used in frameworks and libraries where the framework defines the overall structure of an algorithm, and the user provides specific implementations for certain steps.
- The Template Method Design Pattern is often used in scenarios where:
  - You have a common algorithm that can be reused across multiple classes.
  - You want to allow subclasses to customize specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.
  - You want to promote code reuse and avoid code duplication.

- Example Use Cases:
    - Data processing pipelines where the overall structure is the same, but the specific processing steps may vary.
    - Game development where the game loop structure is common, but the specific game logic may differ between different games.
    - Report generation where the overall report structure is the same, but the content and formatting may vary between different reports.

- Example Code:
```java
abstract class DataProcessor {
    // Template method
    public final void process() {
        readData();
        processData();
        writeData();
    }

    protected abstract void readData();
    protected abstract void processData();
    protected abstract void writeData();
}
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data from CSV file.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing CSV data.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data to CSV file.");
    }
}
class XMLDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data from XML file.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing XML data.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data to XML file.");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor();
        csvProcessor.process();

        DataProcessor xmlProcessor = new XMLDataProcessor();
        xmlProcessor.process();
    }
}
```

- In this example, the `DataProcessor` class defines the template method `process()`, which outlines the steps of reading, processing, and writing data. The subclasses `CSVDataProcessor` and `XMLDataProcessor` provide specific implementations for each step of the algorithm.
- The `process()` method is marked as final to prevent subclasses from overriding it, ensuring that the overall structure of the algorithm remains intact.
- The `main()` method demonstrates how to use the template method pattern by creating instances of the concrete classes and calling the `process()` method. Each concrete class implements the specific steps of the algorithm while reusing the common structure defined in the base class.
- The output of the program will show the specific steps being executed for each data processor, demonstrating how the template method pattern allows for customization while maintaining a common algorithm structure.
- The Template Method Design Pattern is a powerful tool for defining algorithms in a flexible and reusable way, allowing for easy customization and extension of the algorithm's behavior through subclassing.
- The pattern is widely used in various programming languages and frameworks, making it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
