# Design: E-commerce Order Processing with the Strategy Pattern

This document outlines the design for a flexible e-commerce order processing system in Java. The core of this design is the **Strategy Design Pattern**, used to handle dynamic and interchangeable business rules for calculating discounts and shipping costs.

## 1. Scenario

The system needs to process customer orders. A key part of processing is the calculation of the final total, which involves two distinct steps that can vary based on business needs:

1.  **Discount Calculation**: Apply a discount to the order's subtotal. The rules for discounting can change frequently due to seasonal promotions, sales, or customer loyalty programs.
2.  **Shipping Cost Calculation**: Determine the shipping cost for the order. This can depend on various factors like package weight, order value, or shipping destination.

The Strategy pattern is chosen to encapsulate these changing rules into separate, interchangeable objects, preventing the main order processing logic from becoming complex and rigid.

## 2. System Components

The design is broken down into the following components:

### A. Data Models (POJOs)

-   **`Order`**: A Plain Old Java Object (POJO) that represents a customer's order. It contains a list of items, customer information, subtotal, total weight, and will be updated with the calculated discount and shipping costs.
-   **`Customer`**: A POJO representing the customer. It holds relevant information, such as a `LoyaltyTier` (e.g., NONE, SILVER, GOLD), which can be used by certain strategies.

### B. Discount Calculation Strategies

This family of algorithms handles all discount-related logic.

-   **`DiscountStrategy` (Interface)**: Defines the common contract for all discount algorithms.
    ```java
    public interface DiscountStrategy {
        /**
         * Calculates the discount amount for a given order.
         * @param order The order to apply the discount to.
         * @return The calculated discount amount (not the final price).
         */
        double applyDiscount(Order order);
    }
    ```
-   **Concrete Discount Strategy Classes**:
    -   `NoDiscountStrategy`: Applies a zero discount.
    -   `PercentageDiscountStrategy`: Applies a discount based on a percentage of the order subtotal.
    -   `FixedAmountDiscountStrategy`: Applies a fixed monetary discount (e.g., a $10 coupon).
    -   `LoyaltyTierDiscountStrategy`: A more complex strategy that calculates a discount based on the `Customer`'s loyalty tier stored in the `Order`.

### C. Shipping Cost Calculation Strategies

This family of algorithms handles all shipping cost logic.

-   **`ShippingStrategy` (Interface)**: Defines the common contract for all shipping cost algorithms.
    ```java
    public interface ShippingStrategy {
        /**
         * Calculates the shipping cost for a given order.
         * @param order The order for which to calculate shipping.
         * @return The calculated shipping cost.
         */
        double calculateShippingCost(Order order);
    }
    ```
-   **Concrete Shipping Strategy Classes**:
    -   `FlatRateShippingStrategy`: Calculates a single, fixed shipping fee for all orders.
    -   `WeightBasedShippingStrategy`: Calculates shipping cost based on the total weight of the items in the `Order`.
    -   `PremiumShippingStrategy`: A more complex strategy that might offer reduced or free shipping if the `Order` value exceeds a certain threshold, or based on the customer's status.

### D. The Context

-   **`OrderProcessor` (Context Class)**: This is the central class that clients interact with. Its responsibilities are:
    -   To hold a reference to a `DiscountStrategy` object.
    -   To hold a reference to a `ShippingStrategy` object.
    -   To provide public methods (e.g., `setDiscountStrategy()`, `setShippingStrategy()`) that allow a client to change these strategies at runtime.
    -   To have a core method, `processOrder(Order order)`, which uses the currently set strategy objects to perform the discount and shipping calculations and finalize the order total. The `OrderProcessor` delegates the "how" of these calculations to its strategies.
