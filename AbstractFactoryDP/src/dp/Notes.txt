## Abstract Factory Design Pattern:
    - if multiple factories are creating and returning multiple family class objects(related classes of having common super class)
    then we need abstract factory design pattern to make all factories to return multiple family class objects having same standards.
    - Ex.
                            BajajFactory
                          /      |       \
                         /       |        \
                      Pulsar  Discover  Platina
         these are related classes having common super class or commonly implemented interfaces.
         - BajajFactory is a factory that is capable of creating and returning multiple family class objects.
         - Pulsar, Discover, Platina are related classes having common super class or commonly implemented interfaces.
    - It is also called as factory of factories.
    - It is a creational design pattern.
    - It is used to create a set of related objects.
    - Abstract factory makes all the required and related objects are coming from single factory, sp that
    we can avoid problems of getting related objects from different factories.


    # problem 1:
    - here the client is getting freedom to use two different factories to create the objects of the same families
    classes, ie, he is able to save student info in DB s/w and course info in excel file by getting
    two dao objects using two different objects
    - ex. purchasing car from suzuki and accessories from mahindra

    # solution 1:
    - to solve this problem use abstract factory which is factpry of factories or super factory which provides env to
    create and return onr of the several factory class objects for client apps, and client apps uses that objects
    to create all objects of the same family classes.


The **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** provides an interface for creating families of related or
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is part of the **creational design patterns**
and helps in separating the object creation logic from the client code.

#### 2. Core Components of Abstract Factory Pattern
1. **Abstract Factory (`IDAOFactory`)**:
   - Declares the methods to create abstract products.
   - Example in this code: `IDAOFactory` interface defines the `createDao(String type)` method to create different DAOs.

2. **Concrete Factory (`DBDaoFactory`, `ExcelDaoFactory`)**:
   - Implements the abstract factory to create concrete products.
   - Example in this code:
     - `DBDaoFactory`: Creates database-specific DAOs like `DBStudentDao` and `DBCourseDao`.
     - `ExcelDaoFactory`: Creates Excel-specific DAOs like `ExcelStudentDao` and `ExcelCourseDao`.

3. **Abstract Product (`IDAO`)**:
   - Declares the interface for a family of products.
   - Example in this code: `IDAO` interface declares the `insert()` method.

4. **Concrete Product (`DBStudentDao`, `DBCourseDao`, `ExcelStudentDao`, `ExcelCourseDao`)**:
   - Implements the abstract product interface to provide specific functionality.
   - Example in this code:
     - `DBStudentDao` and `DBCourseDao` provide database-specific behavior.
     - `ExcelStudentDao` and `ExcelCourseDao` provide Excel-specific behavior.

5. **Client (`ClientApp`)**:
   - Uses the abstract factory and products without being aware of their concrete implementations.
   - Example in this code: `ClientApp` interacts with `IDAOFactory` and `IDAO` interfaces, making it decoupled
   from the specific DAO implementations.

#### 3. Key Principles of the Abstract Factory Pattern
1. **Encapsulation of Object Creation**:
   - The client code does not directly instantiate concrete classes. Instead, it relies on the factory interface
    to create objects.

2. **Dependency Inversion Principle**:
   - The client depends on abstractions (`IDAOFactory` and `IDAO`), not on concrete implementations
   (`DBStudentDao`, `ExcelCourseDao`, etc.).

3. **Open-Closed Principle**:
   - New factories or products can be added without modifying existing code, making the system extensible.

---

#### 4. Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern
1. **Decoupling**:
   - The client code is decoupled from the specific implementations of the objects it uses.
   - For instance, `ClientApp` does not need to know whether it is working with `DB` or `Excel` DAOs.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Ensures that a family of related objects (e.g., `DBStudentDao` and `DBCourseDao`) are used together.

3. **Scalability**:
   - New families of products (e.g., JSON DAOs) can be added by creating new concrete factories without
   affecting existing code.

4. **Improved Testability**:
   - Factories and their products can be tested independently.

#### 5. How the Abstract Factory Pattern Is Applied in This Code
1. **Abstract Factory (`IDAOFactory`)**:
   - Declares `createDao(String type)` to create DAOs.

2. **Concrete Factories**:
   - `DBDaoFactory`: Produces DAOs for database operations (`DBStudentDao` and `DBCourseDao`).
   - `ExcelDaoFactory`: Produces DAOs for Excel operations (`ExcelStudentDao` and `ExcelCourseDao`).

3. **Abstract Product (`IDAO`)**:
   - Declares `insert()` as a common operation for DAOs.

4. **Concrete Products**:
   - Implement the `IDAO` interface and provide behavior specific to the database or Excel storage mechanisms.

5. **Client (`ClientApp`)**:
   - Interacts with the abstract factory (`IDAOFactory`) and the abstract product (`IDAO`) without being
   aware of their concrete implementations.

---

#### 6. Common Use Cases for Abstract Factory Pattern
1. **GUI Toolkits**:
   - To create consistent UI components across different platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Database Access**:
   - To switch between different database implementations (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).

3. **File Parsers**:
   - To handle different file formats (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV).

4. **Cross-Platform Applications**:
   - To support platform-specific implementations while maintaining a common interface.

#### 7. Visual Representation of Abstract Factory Pattern
Client --> AbstractFactory --> ConcreteFactory1 --> ProductA1, ProductB1 | --> ConcreteFactory2 --> ProductA2, ProductB2


- **Client**: Uses the abstract factory to create products.
- **Abstract Factory**: Declares methods to create abstract products.
- **Concrete Factory**: Implements the abstract factory to create specific products.
- **Products**: Concrete implementations of the abstract products.

#### 8. Comparison with Factory Method Pattern
| **Aspect**             | **Abstract Factory**                                          | **Factory Method**                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Create families of related objects.                           | Create one type of object at a time.                 |
| **Complexity**         | Slightly more complex due to multiple products and factories. | Simpler, as it deals with creating one product only. |
| **Scalability**        | Highly scalable (can add new families of objects).            | Limited scalability compared to Abstract Factory.    |
| **Example in Code**    | `IDAOFactory`, `DBDaoFactory`, `ExcelDaoFactory`.             | Not directly applicable in this context.             |

#### 9. Takeaways for Abstract Factory Pattern
- Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:
  - You need to work with families of related objects.
  - The exact classes to instantiate are determined at runtime.
  - The system needs to be easily extensible for new product families.

This pattern makes the code modular, testable, and easier to maintain. It is especially useful in scenarios where the application might need to switch between different product implementations (e.g., switching from database storage to Excel storage).
