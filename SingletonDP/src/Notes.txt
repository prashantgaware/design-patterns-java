Object cloning:
    - Object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object.
    - It is achieved by implementing Cloneable interface.
    - It is a shallow copy.
    - It is a bit faster than creating a new object using new keyword.
    - It is a bit risky because it involves typecasting.
    - It is not recommended to use clone() method to create a new object.
    4 types of cloning:
        1. Shallow cloning
        2. Deep cloning
        3. Copy constructor
        4. Serialization
    - Initially cvloned object is exactly same as original object. But if we change the cloned object, original object will not be affected.
    - If we change the original object, cloned object will not be affected.
